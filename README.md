# VITA Shade Teeth Whitening Example

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Banuba SDK to apply VITA Shade Teeth Whitening effects to live video streams and photos. VITA Shade is a system used to classify tooth color, allowing users to achieve a natural-looking whitening effect. While this example focuses on live video and photo processing, the effect can also be applied to prerecorded videos, though this functionality is not included here for simplicity. The example also includes a photo comparison feature to view before-and-after results.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- Webcam access for live video stream functionality.
